Also another popular genre of Anime, as the same suggests it deals alot with characters moving around and exploring  new places, these anime tend to be very long and drawn out but the characters typically have a solid background. The anime itself usually has a well formed story-line but due to the nature of this genre viewers often get bored and annoyed at the slow progression. Overall its a pretty decent anime genre and allows pretty much every other genre to almost seamlessly integrate themselves into it. Common mixtures are: Adventure-Action, Adventure-Historical (due to its uncanny ability to tell a story) and Adventure-Slice of Life. Examples of this Genre are Kino no Tabi, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Pokemon.
